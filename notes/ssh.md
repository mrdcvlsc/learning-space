# SSH Keys

Check to see if you have a key already:

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
ls

# Example Output:
authorized_keys2  id_dsa       known_hosts
config            id_dsa.pub
```

You’re looking for a pair of files named something like `id_dsa` or `id_rsa` and
a matching file with a `.pub` extension. The `.pub` file is your public key,
and the other file is the corresponding private key.

# [Generate SSH key (click here)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key)

If you don’t have these files (or you don’t even have a .ssh directory), you can create them by running a program called `ssh-keygen`, which is _provided with the SSH package on Linux/macOS_ systems and comes with _Git for Windows_:


SSH files should appear in your `~/.shh` for ubuntu systems.

# Authenticating Users

This section follows the git tutorial on [how to setup a Git sever](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server).

we will use the `authorized_keys` method for authenticating our users.

You need to add some SSH public keys to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` in the ssh server. 

Let’s assume you have some trusted public keys and have
saved them to temporary files. Again, the public keys look something like this:

```bash
cat /tmp/id_rsa.john.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCB007n/ww+ouN4gSLKssMxXnBOvf9LGt4L
ojG6rs6hPB09j9R/T17/x4lhJA0F3FR1rP6kYBRsWj2aThGw6HXLm9/5zytK6Ztg3RPKK+4k
Yjh6541NYsnEAZuXz0jTTyAUfrtU3Z5E003C4oxOj6H0rfIF1kKI9MAQLMdpGW1GYEIgS9Ez
Sdfd8AcCIicTDWbqLAcU4UpkaX8KyGlLwsNuuGztobF8m72ALC/nLF6JLtPofwFBlgc+myiv

dAv8JggJICUvax2T9va5 gsg-keypair
```

You just append them to the `authorized_keys` file in its `.ssh` directory:

```bash
cat /tmp/id_rsa.john.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
cat /tmp/id_rsa.josie.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
cat /tmp/id_rsa.jessica.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# you can also manually copy it if you want
```

YOU CAN NOW LOGIN VIA SSH KEY IN YOUR LOCAL MACHINE

# SSH login

1. If SSH key authentication is set up, SSH will automatically try to use your private key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa` or `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).

    ```bash
    ssh <user_name>@<ip/domain>
    ```

2. On the other hand if your key is not named as `id_rsa` or `id_ed25519` then
you will need to manually supply it yourself to the command.

    ```
    ssh -i <pub-key-filename> <user_name>@<ip/domain>
    ```

3. Specifying a port number - sometimes ssh use port 8022 instead of the usual port 22 to as an extra layer of security against automated attacks that target port 22.

    ```bash
    ssh -i <pub-key-filename> <user_name>@<ip/domain> -p 8022
    ```

# Permission Classes

We can then futher add a little bit more layer of security in our `.ssh` directory
by:

```bash
cd ~
.ssh
chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys # only owner can read and write `authorized_keys` file
chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa # only owner can read and write private keys 
```
If you want to learn more about permissions continue below.

In a machine like ubuntu we have three permission classes:

1. Owner (User) - `u`
2. Group - `g`
3. Others - `o`
4. All - `a` = `ugo`

# Numeric (Octal) File Permissions

File permissions in Linux/Unix are represented by three digits,
which are octal numbers (base 8), each digit represents
permissions for the; Owner (User), Group, Others.

If we do `ls -l filename` and we assume that the example output is

```bash
-rw-r--r--  1 user user 1234 Feb 28 12:00 myfile.txt
```

Then that would mean the following permission for that file:

- `rw-` (Owner can **r**ead and **w**rite but not e**x**ecute)
- `r--` (Group can only **r**ead but they can't **w**rite or e**x**ecute)
- `r--` (Others can only **r**ead and they can't **w**rite or e**x**ecute)

The corresponding numeric value for this is `644`, if we convert each digit
of this number into binary we would get; `0b110` for `6` and `0b100` for both `4`,
each bit in the binary represents the permission [r][w][x].

Also in `ls -l`, the first character represents the file type:
- `d` - Directory
- `-` - Regular file
- `l` - Symbolic link
- `c` - Character device (e.g., terminal, /dev/tty)
- `b` - Block device (e.g., disk partitions, /dev/sda)
- `p` - Named pipe
- `s` - Socket

# Letters File Permission

If you don't want to use numbers to set permission you can use letters instead.
for example:

```bash
chmod u=rwx,go= my-script.sh
```

Let's break down the command above, the letters `u`, `g`, and `o` are the
`Owner/User`, `Group` and `Others`, while the `r`, `w`, and `x` is the read,
write, and execute permissions. we use the `=` to set certain permission, and
we use the `,` if we want to selectively set permissions to different differently.

### Adding Permission to Everyone Using Letters

The `chmod +x` will add execute permission for `Owner/User`, `Group` and
`Others` to the file or directory, it's the same as `chmod a+x file`

### Adding Permission Selectively Using Letters

- `chmod u+x file` - Add execute for owner (user)
- `chmod g+x file` - Add execute for group
- `chmod o+x file` - Add execute for others

# Key Premission `0664`

### 1. Go to your `.ssh` folder.

    ```bash
    cd /home/$USER/.ssh
    ```

### 2. Check the permission of the private key.

    ```bash
    ls -l id_rsa
    ```

    Output:

    ```bash
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 your_username your_username 1234 Oct 30 12:34 id_rsa
    ```

    The permissions `rw-rw-r--` in the above example are too open (664). To fix this, you should make the file readable and writable only by the owner and not accessible by others.

### 3. Change the permission to the private key

    ```bash
    chmod 600 id_rsa
    ```

    This command sets the file permissions to 600, which means it is readable and writable only by the owner.

### 4. Verify that the permissions have been updated correctly:

    ```bash
    ls -l id_rsa
    ```

    Output:

    ```bash
    -rw------- 1 your_username your_username 1234 Oct 30 12:34 id_rsa
    ```

    The permissions are now correct, and your private key is no longer accessible by others.
