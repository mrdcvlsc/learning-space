# What are multiplexer or mux in web development?

## The big picture

A web server receives an HTTP request, decides **which code should handle it**, runs that code, and returns an HTTP response.

* **Route**: the matching rule or mapping from request shape to code
* **Endpoint**: the actual network-accessible API location, often identified by method + path
* **Handler**: the function or callable that processes a matched request
* **Controller**: an organized unit of handlers, usually in MVC-style architectures
* **Router**: the component that matches requests to handlers
* **Multiplexer / mux**: essentially another name for a router in many server frameworks

---

# 1) Route

A **route** is a rule that connects a request pattern to some code.

A route usually describes things like:

* HTTP method: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.
* path: `/users`, `/users/:id`, `/api/orders`
* sometimes host, headers, query constraints, or content type

Example route definitions:

* `GET /users`
* `POST /users`
* `GET /users/:id`

In many frameworks, “route” can mean either:

1. the **definition** itself, or
2. the **matched path pattern**

So when people say “add a route,” they usually mean “register a rule that maps this request pattern to a handler.”

### Important distinction

A route is not the same thing as the handler.
The route is the **mapping**, while the handler is the **function that runs**.

---

# 2) Endpoint

An **endpoint** is the externally reachable API location where a client can send a request.

In REST-style usage, an endpoint is usually described as:

* an HTTP method plus a URL path, such as:

  * `GET /users`
  * `POST /users`
  * `GET /users/42`

In strict usage, the endpoint is the **interface exposed to the outside world**, while the route is the internal rule that makes it work.

### Common practical meaning

Most developers use “endpoint” to mean:

* one specific request target in an API,
* usually method + path,
* often tied to one handler.

Example:

* `GET /users` is an endpoint
* `POST /users` is another endpoint

### Subtle but useful distinction

An endpoint is often thought of as the **thing the client calls**.
A route is the **server-side rule** used to dispatch that call.

So:

* The client calls an **endpoint**
* The server matches a **route**
* The matched route invokes a **handler**

---

# 3) Handler

A **handler** is the function or callable that actually processes a request.

It takes input from the request, performs logic, and produces a response.

Typical responsibilities:

* read path parameters, query parameters, headers, or body
* validate input
* call business logic or services
* return JSON, HTML, redirect, file, or error response

Example idea in pseudocode:

```text
GET /users/:id -> userHandler
```

`userHandler` is the handler.

### In many frameworks

Handlers may be called:

* route handlers
* request handlers
* view functions
* action functions
* controller methods

But technically, the handler is the executable unit that responds to the request.

### Handler can be very small or very large

A handler might:

* directly return a response in a simple app
* or delegate to services, repositories, and other layers in a large app

---

# 4) Controller

A **controller** is a higher-level organizational concept, common in MVC and similar architectures.

A controller usually groups related handlers together by resource or feature.

For example:

* `UserController`

  * `index()` for `GET /users`
  * `show()` for `GET /users/:id`
  * `create()` for `POST /users`
  * `update()` for `PUT /users/:id`
  * `delete()` for `DELETE /users/:id`

### What a controller is for

Controllers help organize request handling code. They often:

* receive the request
* validate or parse input
* coordinate application logic
* call services
* choose a response

### Not all frameworks use controllers

Some frameworks are “controller-less” or make controllers optional. In those systems, handlers may be defined directly.

### Important distinction

A controller is not the same as a single handler.

A controller is usually:

* a class, module, or grouping
* containing several handlers/actions

A handler is:

* a specific function/method that handles a specific request

So a controller is often a **container or organizer of handlers**.

---

# 5) Router

A **router** is the component that decides which handler should handle a request.

It typically:

1. receives the incoming request
2. checks method, path, maybe host/headers
3. finds the matching route
4. calls the associated handler

Think of it as the traffic director of your application.

### Example behavior

Given these routes:

* `GET /users -> listUsers`
* `GET /users/:id -> showUser`
* `POST /users -> createUser`

The router examines the request and dispatches accordingly.

### Router can also support:

* path parameters
* nested routes
* middleware chains
* route groups
* versioning (`/api/v1/...`)
* host-based routing
* subrouters

---

# 6) Multiplexer / mux

A **multiplexer** is a general computer science term meaning a component that selects one of many inputs or paths and routes it to the right destination.

In web development, a **mux** is usually just a router.

For example, in Go’s `net/http`, `http.ServeMux` is the standard request multiplexer. It matches request patterns and dispatches to handlers.

### Why the name?

Because it “multiplexes” many possible request paths into the correct handler.

### In practical web-dev usage

* **router** and **mux** are often interchangeable
* **multiplexer** is the more formal/full term
* **mux** is shorthand

### Slight nuance

Strictly speaking, “mux” is broader as a computer science concept, while “router” is the web-specific name. But in web frameworks, they usually mean the same thing.

---

# How they fit together

A common flow looks like this:

1. Client sends `GET /users/42`
2. Router / mux checks registered routes
3. It finds the route `GET /users/:id`
4. That route points to a handler, such as `showUserHandler`
5. The handler may be part of a controller, like `UserController.show`
6. The handler returns a response

So conceptually:

* **Endpoint** = what the client calls
* **Route** = the mapping rule on the server
* **Router / mux** = the component that matches requests to routes
* **Handler** = the function that handles the request
* **Controller** = a grouped organizer of related handlers

---

# A concrete example

Suppose you have this API:

* `GET /users`
* `GET /users/123`
* `POST /users`

You might implement it like this:

### Routes

* `GET /users -> UserController.index`
* `GET /users/:id -> UserController.show`
* `POST /users -> UserController.create`

### Endpoints

* `GET /users`
* `GET /users/123`
* `POST /users`

### Router / mux

A component that inspects the request path and method and sends it to the correct controller method.

### Controller

`UserController` groups the user-related actions.

### Handlers

* `index`
* `show`
* `create`

---

# Common confusion points

## “Route” vs “endpoint”

People often use them interchangeably, but a useful distinction is:

* **route**: server-side matching rule
* **endpoint**: exposed request target or API operation

In everyday speech, many developers say “endpoint” when they mean “route,” and vice versa. That is common, but technically the route is the server-side mechanism and the endpoint is the externally addressable interface.

## “Handler” vs “controller”

A controller usually contains handlers.
A handler is the actual request-processing function.

## “Router” vs “mux”

Usually the same thing in web frameworks.

---

# A more precise mental model

If you want a durable technical model, use this:

### Request path through the app

**HTTP request → router/mux → matched route → handler/controller action → response**

### Terms mapped to roles

* **Endpoint**: API operation exposed to clients
* **Route**: rule describing how to match that operation
* **Router / mux**: dispatcher that selects the correct route
* **Handler**: executable code that processes the request
* **Controller**: organizational unit containing related handlers

---

# Framework-specific differences

Different frameworks use these words differently.

For example:

* Some frameworks call every handler a “route”
* Some MVC frameworks emphasize controllers
* Some minimal frameworks skip controllers entirely
* Some Go code uses `mux` heavily
* Some Node frameworks call handlers “middleware” when they are chained

So the “true” meaning depends slightly on context, but the distinctions above are the most technically useful ones.

---

# Best way to use the words correctly

A safe and precise usage is:

* “I defined a route for `GET /users`.”
* “That endpoint returns the user list.”
* “The router dispatches the request.”
* “The handler generates the response.”
* “The controller groups user-related handlers.”
* “The mux matches the request to the handler.”

---

# One-line summary

* **Route**: matching rule
* **Endpoint**: exposed API operation
* **Handler**: function that handles the request
* **Controller**: grouped set of handlers
* **Router / mux**: request dispatcher

---

# Mux in other web frameworks

In **web terms**, a **multiplexer / mux** is the component that takes one incoming request and selects the correct handler among many possible handlers. In Go, that role is explicitly named `ServeMux`; in other ecosystems, the same role is usually called a **router**, **routing middleware**, or a **dispatcher** rather than “mux.” ([Node.js][1])

## 1) Node.js

Plain Node’s core HTTP API does not give you a dedicated router. The function passed to `http.createServer()` is the **request handler**, and it runs once for every request. If you want “mux-like” behavior, you write the dispatch logic yourself: inspect `req.method` and `req.url`, then call the right handler. ([Node.js][1])

```js
const http = require('node:http');

const usersList = (req, res) => res.end('list users');
const userShow  = (req, res) => res.end('show user');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/users') return usersList(req, res);
  if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url.startsWith('/users/')) return userShow(req, res);

  res.statusCode = 404;
  res.end('Not found');
});
```

Here, that `if`/`switch` block is your manual mux/router. ([Node.js][1])

## 2) Express.js

Express has a first-class `Router` and describes routing as defining routes plus route handlers. So in Express, the router is the closest thing to a mux: it matches method/path patterns and dispatches to the matching handler or middleware chain. ([Express][2])

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/users', (req, res) => res.send('list users'));
router.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => res.send(`show user ${req.params.id}`));

app.use('/api', router);
```

That `Router` instance is the dispatching layer people often mean informally when they say “mux” in Express. ([Express][2])

## 3) Fastify.js

Fastify’s docs say its route methods configure the application’s **endpoints**, and each route has a **handler**. So Fastify’s route table is the mux-like component: it matches the request to the configured route and then invokes the handler. ([Fastify][3])

```js
const fastify = require('fastify')();

fastify.get('/users', async (request, reply) => {
  return { message: 'list users' };
});

fastify.get('/users/:id', async (request, reply) => {
  return { message: `show user ${request.params.id}` };
});
```

In Fastify, the “mux” idea is built into the route system itself rather than exposed as a separate `Mux` object. ([Fastify][3])

## 4) NestJS

Nest uses **controllers** and a routing mechanism that decides which controller handles each request. Its docs explicitly say controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests, and the routing mechanism determines which controller handles each request. ([docs.nestjs.com][4])

```ts
import { Controller, Get, Param } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {
  @Get()
  list() {
    return 'list users';
  }

  @Get(':id')
  show(@Param('id') id: string) {
    return `show user ${id}`;
  }
}
```

In NestJS, the mux-like part is mostly the framework’s routing layer plus controller metadata, not a separate object you normally manipulate directly. ([docs.nestjs.com][4])

## 5) Java Spring Boot / Spring MVC

Spring MVC is built around the **front controller** pattern, where `DispatcherServlet` is the central servlet that dispatches requests to registered handlers/controllers. Spring’s docs say it provides the shared request-processing algorithm, while delegate components do the actual work. ([Home][5])

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
class UsersController {

  @GetMapping
  public String list() {
    return "list users";
  }

  @GetMapping("/{id}")
  public String show(@PathVariable String id) {
    return "show user " + id;
  }
}
```

So in Spring, the mux-like role is primarily played by `DispatcherServlet` plus handler mappings. The controller methods are the handlers that get selected. ([Home][5])

## 6) .NET / ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core routing is described as the mechanism that matches incoming HTTP requests and dispatches them to the app’s **executable endpoints**. When you use controllers, routing maps URLs to **actions**. ([Microsoft Learn][6])

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("users")]
public class UsersController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public string List() => "list users";

    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public string Show(string id) => $"show user {id}";
}
```

In .NET, the mux-like role is the routing system itself, and the selected target is an endpoint or controller action. ([Microsoft Learn][6])

## The clean way to remember it

Across these stacks, the “mux” idea maps like this:

* **Node.js**: your manual `if/switch` dispatch inside the request handler. ([Node.js][1])
* **Express**: `Router`. ([Express][2])
* **Fastify**: route registration / route matcher. ([Fastify][3])
* **NestJS**: framework routing mechanism feeding controllers. ([docs.nestjs.com][4])
* **Spring Boot**: `DispatcherServlet` plus handler mappings. ([Home][5])
* **ASP.NET Core**: routing middleware / endpoint routing. ([Microsoft Learn][6])

So the main correction is: **“mux” is a perfectly good concept, but only Go tends to call it that explicitly.** In most other ecosystems, you will usually say **router**, **dispatcher**, or **routing system** instead. ([Node.js][1])
